List of required dependencies to run application:

In order to run the API, node must be installed so the server can be started. 

Once node is installed, Open terminal, and navigate to the directory where the application is located.

Then enter 'npm start' to start the server 

To test queries, POSTMAN is ideal to query the database, however the local host can be used.

For example, http://localhost:2000/sensors retrieves all sensors in the database.
