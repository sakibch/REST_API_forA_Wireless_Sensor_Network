# REST API for Wireless Sensor Network
This repository is for the dissertation I completed during university studying Computer Science and Business Management. 

**I built a REST API using Node.js which facilitates the interaction between wireless sensors in a network. I also reduced API latency by 30% by hosting database on MongoDB compared to SQL servers.**

List of required dependencies to run application:

In order to run the API, node must be installed so the server can be started. 

Once node is installed, Open terminal, and navigate to the directory where the application is located.

Then enter 'npm start' to start the server 

To test queries, POSTMAN is ideal to query the database, however the local host can be used.

For example, http://localhost:2000/sensors retrieves all sensors in the database.
